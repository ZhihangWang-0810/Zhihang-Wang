### Research

Plasmonic lattices can confine light at nano-scale space and enhance light-matter interaction, in order to precisely manipulate the optical field spatially and achieve remarkable optical properties. Besides, light-matter interaction can be further enhanced by strong coupling within plasmonic lattices, which generally occurs when periodic energy exchanged between two subsystems (a) is larger than that of dissipative loss, with the anticrossing splitting of energy levels (b). By applying theoretical and experimental techniques, the strong coupling within plasmonic lattices can be tailored precisely, which can find applications in quantum optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) (c) and so on.
